    <h1>Friend or Threat</h1>

    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, unveiling a new horizon, where possibilities.<br />
      boundless, stepping onto the path of progress. If it arrives as a
      friend,.<br />
      life will become easier, providing new vigor in solving problems.
      However,<br />
      if it becomes a threat, it can take away jobs, creating discord and<br />
      adversity. Uncontrolled AI can bring disaster, casting a dark shadow
      over<br />
      the existence of humankind. Therefore, caution and proper use are<br />
      necessary, binding it with the ties of ethics, its reform must be done.<br />
      Friend or threat, the answer to this question, depends on our use of
      it.<br />
      If driven on the right path, AI will be a friend, otherwise, it can
      become<br />
      a great enemy.<br /><br />
